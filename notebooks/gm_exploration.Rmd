## Exploring Gapminder

Load data

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_data.csv")

```


how can I compare life expectancy by country?

here's function that makes a **panel plot** using `facet_wrap` on country

make sure to filter on continent otherwise it's unreadable

Pull in the function to make this plot in the gdp script:


```{r}
# Remember it's in
# the scripts folder of the project, and this document is in the notebooks folder
# of this project, so to get the correct path to it from here, 
# must first go 'up' the path with `../`

source('../scripts/gdp.R')

```

loop through all continents and call the function for each one. 


```{r}
for(continent in unique(gapminder$continent)) {
  gm_plot <- gapminder_by_continent(gapminder, continent)
  print(gm_plot)
}
```
